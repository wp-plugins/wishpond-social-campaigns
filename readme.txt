= What is the difference between Social Offers and Social Sweepstakes? =

With Social Campaigns you can create 3 kinds of promotions: Social Offers, Social Sweepstakes, and Photo Contests. 

Social Offers lets you create limited-time offers on your goods or services. You get to choose all the parameters of the offer. For example you can set a minimum number of participants required to 'unlock' the deal, making it a group buying promotion. You can choose any good or service (or group of goods and services) to create a Social Offer for. You choose the number of people who can participate, the duration of the promotion, the redemption method and instructions, and of course the size of the discount. 

Social Sweepstakes is used to run giveaways which people are required to enter to win. Again, all the parameters of the Social Sweepstakes are up to you. You choose what you want to give away, and how long the Social Sweepstakes will run for. 

Both Social Offers and Social Sweepstakes spread through the major social networks as people participate. That's why we call them social!
